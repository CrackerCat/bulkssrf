This is a Rust port of [m4ll0k](https://twitter.com/m4ll0k2) `ssrf.py` script. 
### Installation
Precompiled binaries for bssrf are available in the [releases](https://github.com/junnlikestea/bulkssrf/releases) tab. Just pick your platform and extract the archive that contains the binary.

## Building it yourself 
If you want to build it yourself you will need to install Rust, you can get the [official installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) from the Rust website.

To build BulkSSRF:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/junnlikestea/bulkssrf
$ cd bulkssrf

$ ./target/release/bssrf --version
```

### Usage
With a list of urls in a file:
```
bssrf -f path/to/file.txt -l xyzburpcollaborator.com
```

Using a tool like `gau` to feed bssrf urls:

gau hackerone.com | bssrf -l xyzburpcollaborator.com
```

By default the program has timeout set to 5 seconds, but you can alter that with the `-t` flag, you can also add various debugging
info with the `-v` for verbose flag:
```
gau hackerone.com | bssrf -v -t 10 -l xyzburpcollaborator.com 
```
